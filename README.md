# **Alarm Clock⏰**

This is a simple alarm clock application built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The application allows users to set an alarm, which will play a sound at the specified time. It also displays a countdown timer until the alarm time and shows the current time and date.

## Features

- **Set Alarm Time** ⏰: Easily set an alarm in the 24-hour format to fit your schedule.
- **Countdown Timer** 🕒: Watch the time tick down to the moment your alarm is set to sound.
- **Current Time and Date Display** 📅: Stay informed with a live display of the current time and date.
- **Alarm Sound** 🔊: Be alerted with a sound at the exact time you've set.
- **Manual Alarm Dismissal** ✋: Gain control by stopping the alarm sound manually whenever you need to.


## 🌟 Overview
This application serves as a customizable alarm clock, allowing users to set alarms for specific times and dates. It features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter and sound functionalities powered by Pygame, ensuring you never miss a beat!

## 📚 Libraries
The application utilizes several libraries to provide a seamless experience:
- `tkinter`: For crafting the GUI components.
- `pygame`: To orchestrate sound playback.
- `PIL` (Pillow): For image processing prowess.
- Standard libraries like `datetime` and `threading` for managing the sands of time and concurrent execution.

## 🌐 Global Variables
Global variables are the backbone of the application, maintaining its state, while the Pygame mixer is tuned to manage the symphony of sounds.

## 🛠 Functions
- `alarm(set_alarm_timer)`: A vigilant watchman, comparing the current time with the set alarm time and unleashing the alarm sound upon a match.
- `actual_time()`: A timekeeper, validating the user's input time and initiating the alarm and countdown in separate threads.
- `stop_alarm()`: A silent guardian, offering the power to halt the alarm sound.
- `show_current_time()`: A timeless display, showcasing the current time and date in a message box for user reference.
- `countdown(set_alarm_timer)`: A countdown conductor, managing a visual display leading up to the alarm time.

## 🎨 UI Components
The main window, along with a suite of labels, entry widgets, and buttons, are constructed using Tkinter to provide an interactive environment for setting and managing alarms with ease and style.
